# SWI_Prolog
This repository is part of a project for the language structure discipline. 
The objective of this project was to choose a language that I had no idea about and then try to learn a little about it. 
The language chosen was Prolog (SWI - Prolog) due to its greater popularity compared to other Prolog distributions.
